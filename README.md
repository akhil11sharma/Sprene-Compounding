# Sprene-Compounding: Automated Data Management & Excel Toolkit

---

## üåü Project Overview

**Sprene-Compounding** is a Python-based suite of GUI tools developed to streamline data management, Excel formula extraction, and folder validation tasks. The core of this system is a user-friendly dashboard that integrates various utilities for efficient interaction with SQL Server databases and local files‚Äîall wrapped in an intuitive interface.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Main Dashboard (GUI):** Central hub for launching all utilities.
- **Table Editor (CRUD System):** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on SQL Server tables with an intuitive interface.
- **Folder Auto-Sync to Database:** Automatically import and synchronize `.csv`, `.xlsx`, and `.xls` files from a specified folder into SQL Server, ensuring the database is always up-to-date.
- **PDF Folder Checker & Cleaner:** Scan folders for unwanted PDF files and easily remove them.
- **Excel Formula Extractor:** Extract all formulas from an Excel worksheet, map them to headers and cell locations, and store them in the database for auditing and documentation.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed  
- **SQL Server** configured (ensure connection details are updated in the respective scripts, e.g., `CURD_FILE.py`, `Folder_to_Database.py`, `Table_area.py`)
- **Required Python libraries:**  
  Install dependencies with:

  ```bash
  pip install tkinter ttkbootstrap pyodbc pandas openpyxl
  ```

  > _Note_:  
  > - `tkinter` is usually bundled with Python, but `ttkbootstrap` provides modern styling.  
  > - `openpyxl` is crucial for Excel operations.  
  > - You may need to install the [ODBC Driver for SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server) if it's not already present.

### üö¶ Running the Dashboard

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akhil11sharma/Sprene-Compounding.git
   cd Sprene-Compounding
   ```

2. **Launch the main dashboard:**

   ```bash
   python Sprerene.py
   ```

3. **Interact with the tools:**  
   From the dashboard, click buttons to open each specific utility in a separate window.

## üì¶ Module Descriptions

This project is modular, with each core functionality encapsulated in its own Python script.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Sprerene.py ‚Äî Main Dashboard Launcher

**Purpose:**  
Primary GUI dashboard providing quick access to all core tools for database and file operations.

**Highlights:**
- Built with `tkinter` for a modern split-pane dashboard.
- Launches other utility scripts (`CURD_FILE.py`, `Folder_to_Database.py`, `folder_validation.py`, `Table_area.py`) as independent processes using `subprocess.Popen`.
- Includes tooltips, file dialog support, and tracks the currently selected file.
- Provides status and help messages for an improved user experience.

**Usage:**  
```bash
python Sprerene.py
```
_Run this to open the main application dashboard._

### üìä CURD_FILE.py ‚Äî Table Editor (CRUD System)

**Purpose:**  
Graphical user interface to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on SQL Server tables.

**Highlights:**
- Connects to SQL Server via `pyodbc`.
- Loads available tables into a dropdown for selection.
- Displays table contents in a `Treeview` grid.
- Add, edit, and delete rows directly from the GUI.
- Changes are committed to the SQL Server database.

**Usage:**  
- Run directly, or launch from `Sprerene.py`.
- Select a table and manage its data visually.

---

### üìÅ Folder_to_Database.py ‚Äî Folder Auto-Sync to Database

**Purpose:**  
Automatically imports all `.csv`, `.xlsx`, and `.xls` files from a specified folder into SQL Server, keeping tables updated.

**Highlights:**
- Scans folder for supported file types.
- Reads files with `pandas`, validates, and cleans data.
- Dynamically creates or updates matching tables in SQL Server.
- Inserts data and metadata (table name, column/row count).
- Periodically rescans for new or changed files (every 30s).
- Logs actions and errors in the GUI.
- Start/stop synchronization with a button.

**Usage:**  
- Run directly, or launch from `Sprerene.py`.
- Configure your folder, then start the sync.

---

### üìÇ folder_validation.py ‚Äî PDF Folder Checker & Cleaner

**Purpose:**  
Scans a folder for unwanted `.pdf` files and provides a GUI to selectively or entirely delete them.

**Highlights:**
- Displays all found PDF files in a dropdown.
- Allows deletion of individual or all PDFs with a single click.
- Periodically rescans folder (every 10s).
- Informative message boxes for actions, errors, and statuses.

**Usage:**  
- Run directly, or launch from `Sprerene.py`.
- Keep Excel-focused folders free of unwanted PDFs.

---

### üìê Table_area.py ‚Äî Excel Formula Extractor

**Purpose:**  
Extracts all formulas from a selected Excel worksheet, maps them to headers and cell locations, and stores them in the database for auditing.

**Highlights:**
- Prompts user to select an Excel file via file dialog.
- Loads workbook, scans all cells for formulas.
- Extracts formula string, associated header, cell name, and involved columns.
- Saves discovered formulas and metadata to a database table.
- Provides feedback on extraction process.

**Usage:**  
- Run directly, or launch from `Sprerene.py`.
- Select an Excel file to extract and store its formulas for auditing.
